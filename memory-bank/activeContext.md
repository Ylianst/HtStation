# Active Context: HtStation

## Current Work Focus

### Primary Task: Web Interface Examination
Currently engaged in examining the HtStation web interface at `http://radio.local:8089/` to provide user feedback on design, functionality, and user experience.

### Memory Bank Initialization
In the process of establishing the complete Memory Bank documentation system for the HtStation project, including all core files required for project continuity.

## Recent Changes

### Code Analysis Completed
- **Web Server Analysis**: Examined `src/webserver.js` - comprehensive understanding of HTTP/WebSocket server implementation
- **Frontend Analysis**: Reviewed `web/index.html`, `web/style.css`, `web/script.js` - complete understanding of web interface structure
- **Configuration Review**: Analyzed `config.ini` - station configuration and network settings identified

### Architecture Understanding
- **Service Architecture**: Modular design with separate BBS, APRS, WinLink, and Web services
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket-based live updates for system monitoring
- **Data Management**: Structured storage system for messages, bulletins, and connection history

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Complete Memory Bank**: Finish initialization of remaining core documentation files
2. **Web Interface Access**: Use browser automation to visit and examine the live web interface
3. **Functionality Testing**: Navigate through different sections and observe real-time features
4. **User Feedback**: Provide comprehensive assessment of interface design and functionality

### Planned Activities
1. **Interface Navigation**: Explore all major sections (Overview, Connections, Bulletins, Mail)
2. **Real-time Observation**: Monitor live updates and WebSocket functionality
3. **Interactive Testing**: Test bulletin creation, mail composition, and other interactive features
4. **Responsive Analysis**: Evaluate interface behavior across different screen sizes

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Web Interface Evaluation Criteria
- **Usability**: Intuitive navigation and clear information hierarchy
- **Real-time Performance**: Responsiveness of live updates and data refresh
- **Feature Completeness**: Coverage of all station management functions
- **Visual Design**: Professional appearance and readability
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of network issues or service interruptions

### Technical Assessment Focus
- **Code Quality**: Organization and maintainability of frontend/backend code
- **Performance**: Efficiency of real-time updates and data processing
- **Scalability**: Ability to handle multiple concurrent users
- **Reliability**: Robustness of WebSocket connections and error recovery

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Development Approach
- **Modular Design**: Preference for well-organized, maintainable code structure
- **Real-time Communication**: Emphasis on responsive, live-updating interfaces
- **Error Resilience**: Importance of graceful failure handling in critical systems
- **Documentation**: Commitment to comprehensive documentation for maintainability

### User Experience Priorities
- **Remote Management**: Critical for ham radio operators who need off-site access
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Essential for tracking active connections and system status
- **Emergency Readiness**: WinLink mail system must be reliable for emergency communications
- **Operational Simplicity**: Interface should minimize training requirements

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Technical Architecture Insights
- **Service Integration**: Well-designed event system enables loose coupling between services
- **Storage Strategy**: File-based storage provides simplicity without external dependencies
- **WebSocket Implementation**: Sophisticated real-time communication system for live monitoring

### Operational Understanding
- **Multi-Purpose Station**: Single callsign (KK7VZT) supporting multiple functions (BBS, Echo, WinLink)
- **Emergency Communications**: WinLink integration provides critical emergency messaging capability
- **Remote Accessibility**: Web interface enables station management from anywhere

### Development Patterns
- **Configuration-Driven**: Station behavior controlled through config.ini file
- **Event-Driven Updates**: Real-time interface updates driven by service events
- **Modular Components**: Each major function (BBS, APRS, WinLink) implemented as separate module
