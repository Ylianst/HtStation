# Product Context: HtStation

## Why HtStation Exists

HtStation addresses the growing need for comprehensive digital communication management in amateur radio operations. Traditional ham radio operations often rely on separate tools and manual processes for different digital modes, creating complexity and potential for errors.

## Problems It Solves

### Communication Fragmentation
- **Problem**: Ham radio operators typically use separate software for BBS, APRS, and WinLink operations
- **Solution**: Unified platform managing all digital communication modes through a single system

### Remote Station Management
- **Problem**: Physical access required for station monitoring and configuration
- **Solution**: Web-based dashboard enabling remote monitoring and control of all station functions

### Emergency Communications
- **Problem**: Emergency communication systems often lack integration and real-time monitoring
- **Solution**: WinLink email system with web interface for emergency message handling

### Data Management
- **Problem**: Connection logs, messages, and bulletins stored in disparate formats
- **Solution**: Structured storage system with web interface for data access and management

## How HtStation Should Work

### User Experience Goals
1. **Single Point of Control**: Operators should manage all station functions from one interface
2. **Real-time Awareness**: Live monitoring of connections, messages, and system status
3. **Remote Accessibility**: Full station control and monitoring from any web browser
4. **Data Accessibility**: Easy access to historical data and connection statistics

### Operational Flow
1. **Station Startup**: Automatic initialization of all services (BBS, APRS, WinLink, Web Server)
2. **Connection Handling**: Automatic detection and management of incoming packet connections
3. **Message Processing**: Real-time processing and storage of BBS messages and APRS packets
4. **Web Monitoring**: Live updates to web interface showing current station status

### Key User Workflows
- **Station Monitoring**: View active connections and system status in real-time
- **Message Management**: Read, compose, and manage BBS bulletins and WinLink emails
